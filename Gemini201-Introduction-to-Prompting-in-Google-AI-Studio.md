# Introduction-to-Prompting-in-Google-AI-Studio

## Introduction

**Prompt engineering** means refining prompts to yield the best and most consistent outcomes.

**Google AI Studio** is a standalone environment for experimenting with Gemini models



### Zero-shot and Few-shot Prompts

A "shot" is the number of examples you provide in your prompt.



**Zero Shot Prompts**

Ask a question without providing any examples, and get the correct response back.



**Few-Shot Prompts**

Provide a few examples of valid inputs and outputs to perform a task that was not well-represented in the training data.



### System Instructions

It used to customize the tone or style of all text generated by the model, across all prompts that are passed in. 

e.g. 
> Answer in a short paragraph
> Answer in a haiku

### Token Counts

Tokens are the basic units of inputs and outputs for LLMs. 

e.g. Word Tokenization, Sentence Tokenization, Subword Tokenization, Character Tokenization

Google AI Studio shows a "Token Count" that **represents the number of tokens of the context window that have been used up.**



### Temperature

 the level of randomness used in the text generation process (creative vs deterministic)



### Stop Sequence

 Tells the model that it should stop generating text once it generates a particular sequence of characters. (Limit topic )



### Safety Settings

Prevent the model from producing certain types of harmful content (Sexually explicit, violence)



## Prompting Methods

### Prompt Tuning

Adding additional instructions to the prompt to help generate the text that you want. 

- What is photosynthesis?
- What is photosynthesis? Explain this to a kindergarten student
- What is photosynthesis? Explain this like it is an abstract to a research paper that is written by a college professor

###  Multimodal Prompts

Gemini models are able to take prompts in various different formats (text, audio, image, video)

### Structured Prompting

Specify input-output pairs

When you provide additional inputs, Gemini will produce new outputs that resemble the specified ones.



## Advanced Prompting Methods

### Chat vs Structured Prompts

**Chat prompts** format: inputs and outputs is conversational, less important structure.

**Structured prompts** are best when the outputs follows a specific format. (JSON format)



### Chain-of-Thought Prompting 

- Ask the model to explain its logic step by step
- e.g. related to math or logic
-  can be implemented using a **zero-shot prompt**, where you simply add the phrase "Explain your answer step by step" to the prompt.
-  can be implemented using **a k-shot prompt** where you include examples of step-by-step reasoning.

### Sharing Prompts

Save your prompts to your Google Drive



### High-Level Prompt Types

**Evaluative**, requires the model to make judgements or evaulations based on certain criteria

**Hypothetical**, involve imagined or speculative scenarios to see how the model handles creative or unusual situations.



## Specific Prompt Types

Each of the following prompt types can work for either evaluative or hypothetical prompts.

- **Direct query:** Straightforward questions or requests for information
- **Instructional:** Direct model to perform a task or to follow a set of instructions
- **Creative:** Generate original and creative content
- **Conversational:** Engage in dialogue, often emulating human-like interactions
- **Contextual:** Provide background information for the model to consider
- **Comparative:** Ask the model to compare and contrast items, concepts, scenarios, etc.
